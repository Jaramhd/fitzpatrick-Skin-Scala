- Capabilities and limitations
   - 2 points: Capabilities are described as extensive (“Large language models are powerful technological tools that can process and produce human text. They have acquired this ability by ‘reading’ enormous amounts of human text data during training. Similar to someone reading a whole library and half of the internet, large language models have acquired a structural understanding of language and accumulated information about the world.”), with several more specific use cases (e.g. question answering, summarization). By comparison, limitations are not described.
