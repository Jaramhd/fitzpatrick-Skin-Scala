**AI21 (Jurassic-2)**

- Data sources
   - 0 points: Was unable to find any description of training data other than “All J2 models were trained on a massive corpus of text”
   - Source: <https://docs.ai21.com/docs/jurassic-2-models> ; <https://docs.ai21.com/docs> 
- Data governance
   - 0 points: Was unable to find any discussion of data governance re datasets for J2. AI21’s usage guidelines direct users to a technical [paper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60fd4503684b466578c0d307/61138924626a6981ee09caf6_jurassic_tech_paper.pdf) outlining biases in datasets for Jurassic-1 models, but it has not been updated. No measures to identify suitability of datasets for use and how to mitigate biases are included.

      - Note: Updating the J1 technical paper would go most of the way to compliance here.

- Capabilities and limitations
   - 2 points: Capabilities are described as significant “J2 models can be applied to virtually any language task” with use cases including generating code (and translating between coding languages), writing copy for marketing, checking and correcting grammar, and helping with creative writing. Limitations are implicitly mentioned in the usage guidelines (e.g., prohibiting automated decisionmaking).

- Risks and mitigations
   - 2 points: risks implicitly referenced, several mitigations laid out. No description of how much mitigations reduce risk or jusitification re non-mitigated risks.

- Evaluations
   - 0 points: Was unable to find any evaluations related to accuracy, unintentional harms, intentional harms, robustness, or other factors.

- Testing (additive)
   - 1 point: press release references internal testing using HELM’s repository, but specific results are not reported. No external evaluations, red teaming, or stress-testing has been reported.

- Machine-generated content
   - 3 points: Playground makes it somewhat clear that content is machine generated. Usage guidelines contain several measures related to machine generated content, including “No content generated by AI21 Studio will be posted automatically (without human intervention) to any public website or platform where it may be viewed by an audience greater than 100 people”; “In any case, the first human to view text generated by AI21 Studio must not be led to believe that it was written by a human: Example: If you’re building a copywriting tool for marketing professionals, your users must be informed that the text proposed to them is machine generated. They are then free to use and present it as their own, at their discretion.”

      - Note: could have given only 2 points–lack of watermarking isn’t the only issue here (the lack of restrictions on resharing is unfortunate)–but AI21’s measures to mitigate the spread of content that may not be labeled as machine-generated are fairly good.
- Member states
