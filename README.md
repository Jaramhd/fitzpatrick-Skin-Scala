# The Foundation Model Transparency Index

We evaluate the practices of foundation model providers like OpenAI and Google. For our first release in June 2023, we score foundation model providers for their compliance with the EU Parliament's AI Act requirements.  


## Methodology.
1. We identify 22 requirements in the EU Parliament's [draft AI Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230609IPR96212/meps-ready-to-negotiate-first-ever-rules-for-safe-and-transparent-ai) that are directed towards foundation model providers in `requirements.md`.
2. We select 12 of these 22 requirements to evaluate, justifying why we excluded the remaining 10, in `requirements.md`.  
3. We design 5-point rubrics for each of 12 requirements in `rubrics.md`.  
4. We select 10 major foundation providers (e.g. OpenAI, Google) to assess, designating a flagship foundation model that represents the provider for the purposes of our evaluation.
5. We rate all 10 providers for all 12 requirements, producing the final scores in `results.png`. Every underlying score comes with an explicit justification for why and provenance for the information we used to make our decisions in `/grades`.
